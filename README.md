This is a barcode scanner mobile application capable of scanning all types of barcodes and QR codes.
This was developed on .NET MAUI which is aframework used to build native, cross-platform desktop and mobile apps from a single C# codebase for Android, iOS, Mac, and Windows.
I used the help of Google Vision API as well.
